# Ping Pong Game

Simple Java Swing GUI demonstrating a square window with a "Start Game" button. The code is organized using a minimal MVC pattern.

## Building

Compile all sources with `javac`:

```bash
javac $(find src -name '*.java')
```

Run the application (requires a graphical environment):

```bash
java -cp src/main/java com.pingponggame.Main
```
